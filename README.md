Project Overview: Student Grades System

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3096de2-4ae4-4247-8ed4-bdb5b6ee5bb6)


Objective: 
The project aims to create a Java program that calculates and evaluates the performance of students based on their grades across multiple subjects or assignments. It computes a weighted average grade, determines the overall letter grade, calculates GPA, and provides personalized feedback based on performance.

Features:
Input Handling:

Accepts the number of subjects or assignments from the user.
Collects grades and corresponding weights (as percentages) for each subject.

Grade Processing:

Computes individual letter grades for each subject using predefined thresholds.
Calculates the weighted average grade based on user-provided weights.

GPA Calculation:

Converts the weighted average grade into a GPA using a standard 4.0 scale.
Feedback Generation:

Provides tailored feedback based on the calculated GPA, offering encouragement or advice.

Output Results:

Displays detailed information for each subject, including numerical grades, letter grades, and weights.
Summarizes overall performance with the weighted average grade, overall letter grade, and GPA.

Key Methods:

getLetterGrade(double grade)

Converts a numerical grade into a letter grade (A-F) based on fixed ranges.
getGPA(double averageGrade)

Translates the weighted average grade into a GPA on a 4.0 scale.
getFeedback(double gpa)

Provides qualitative feedback based on the calculated GPA.

Functional Flow:

User inputs the number of subjects and provides grades and weights for each.
The program validates and processes these inputs:
Computes weighted contributions for each subject.
Calculates the total weighted average grade.
Based on the average grade, the program determines:
Overall letter grade.
Overall GPA.
Displays detailed results per subject and overall performance.
Offers personalized feedback to motivate or guide the student.

Use Cases:

For students to self-assess their academic performance.
For educators to provide automated performance evaluations.
As a foundational program for building more complex academic management systems.

Future Enhancements:

Include error handling for invalid inputs.
Support for different grading scales (e.g., international grading systems).
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better user experience.
Persistent storage for tracking multiple students' grades over time.
